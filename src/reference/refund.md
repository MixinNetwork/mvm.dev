# Complete MVM Contract Development Example refund.sol

In the previous part, we introduced the main functions implemented by MVM. In this article, we will show how to develop a complete contract based on MVM.  Including the following parts:

1. Implement the solidity contract. Here we use refund.sol as an example, while other contracts are in similar process. The open source code is at the end of the article. 
2. Deploy the refund contract on the quorum, with the same operation as the deployment of the EVM contract. 
3. Publish contracts on MVM
4. Mixin users use the contracts 

## Refund Contract Implementation

`refund.sol` implements a smart contract for user transfers and automatic refunds. For the development of smart contracts based on MVM, two functions `function _pid()` and `function _work(Event)` need to be implemented:   

1. `function _pid() internal pure override(MixinProcess) returns (uint128)`

    PID is needed for each contract, which is the client_id of Mixin bot (or bot user), for example:  
    
    Bot user id: 27d0c319-a4e3-38b4-93ff-cb45da8adbe1, by removing `-` and adding `0x` in front of user id, you can get PID: 0x27d0c319a4e338b493ffcb45da8adbe1

    The PID is bound to the contract address of the smart contract in MVM. 

    Note: The client_id of the bot can only be used once, that is to say, it can only be bound to one contract. 
    
2. `function _work(Event memory evt) internal override(MixinProcess) returns (bool)`

    This is contract execution function. By this function, the token that the user transfers to the contract will be returned. 

There is source code and open source address at the end of the article for this.

## Deploy the Contract on Quorum

Developers can choose the deployment method they are familiar with, such as remix, hardhat, etc.

Here is a deployment example for hardhat, https://github.com/MixinNetwork/mvmcontracts, which can be used directly if the quorum testnet has been configured.

TODO: To add refund deployment commands.

## Publish the Contract on MVM

After the smart contract is deployed on Quorum, it needs to be bound to the Mixin bot on the MVM (publish the contract). MVM will package the data based on the PID, send it to Quorum, and return the execution result in the Quorum to the Mixin user. 

Publishing a contract is a multi-signature transfer to MTG, which will contain contract address, PID, contract address and other information in the memo. 

1. The developer needs to transfer CNB with the amount >= 1 to MTG, with the code of Operation as the memo
2. After the MVM receives the output, it will parse the memo, verify some basic information such as the contract address etc., and save this process information if requirements are met.   
3. The contract execution work will be described in detail in the next step of calling the contract.  

memo is the encoding of Operation:

```golang
op := &encoding.Operation{
  Purpose:  encoding.OperationPurposeAddProcess, // fixed value of contract publish 11
  Process:  key.ClientId, // bot client_id, for example：27d0c319-a4e3-38b4-93ff-cb45da8adbe1 
  Platform: c.String("platform"), // if it is an EVM contract, the value is quorum
  Address:  c.String("address"), // EVM contract address
  Extra:    []byte(c.String("extra")), // optional, value is META if automatically create assets is needed 
}
```

1. POST /transactions interface

  Request parameters:

  ```

    }
    ```

2. You can also refer to the Golang code example: https://github.com/MixinNetwork/trusted-group/blob/master/mvm/publish.go

3. 也可以参考 Golang 代码示例：<https://github.com/MixinNetwork/trusted-group/blob/master/mvm/publish.go>

    ```shell
    mvm publish -m config/config.toml \
    -k keystore.json \
    -a 0x2A4630550Ad909B90aAcD82b5f65E33afFA04323 \
    -e META
  ```

  * -a: refers to the address of the contract, which needs to be case sensitive
  * -e: optional META, with or without asset information
  * -m: configuration file, example address: https://github.com/MixinNetwork/trusted-group/blob/master/mvm/config/config.example.toml, only the two configurations of members and threshold in mtg.genesis are used here
  members is the id of the multi-signature node in MTG. The MTG nodes in the example are the real nodes in the testnet, which can be used directly  
  * -k: the contract needs to be bound to a Mixin user, and keystore.json is the user's private key and pin information 

3. It is recommended to use the contract bot 7000103716 to publish the contract.

All of the above three methods can be used to publish the bot with the same effect.

## How to Call the Contract

Mixin users use the contract through MTG's multi-signature transfer. Thus, the developer needs to generate a link for the user to do MTG multi-signature transaction. 

1. The developer generates a https://mixin.one/codes/:id，
	
   encode Operation and use it as memo, call POST /payments interface, here is related documentation:
   https://developers.mixin.one/zh-CN/docs/api/transfer/payment

   There is no limit on the amount but minimum 0.00000001, and the tokens should be the ones Mixin mainnet supported. 

2. For the user payment, users can use the mixin messenger to scan the code (or evoke) to pay. 

Operation structure

```golang
op := &encoding.Operation{
	Purpose: encoding.OperationPurposeGroupEvent, // fixed value 1
	Process: c.String("process"), // client_id of bot
	Extra:   extra, // the content of the contract execution，empty for the refund contract 
}
```

The following is a brief description of the internal implementation principle of MVM:

1. After the user completes the payment, MVM will receive the output, and by parsing the memo of the output, it will get the asset, amount, executed contract address and other related information, and then save them as an Event 
2. MVM encodes the Event according to the required format and then sends it to the refund contract 
3. Refund de-encode Event, with simple verification of the timestamp and nonce 
4. After the execution is completed, return the refund information to MVM through ` event MixinTransaction(bytes);`  
   Note: `event MixinTransaction(bytes)` can only be used in the contract registered with publish, while other contracts cannot use it  
5. Once MVM receives the execution result, it returns the Token to the user

    emit MixinTransaction(log);

    return true;
  }
}

## Conclusion

The refund includes the entire process of deploying the contract through MVM and calling the contract by the user, but the developer cannot directly migrate the original smart contract, because some modifications are needed. 

In order to facilitate developers to use the original contract directly, we implemented registry.sol. Through the registry, the original contract can be migrated directly without any modification. Next, we will introduce the implementation and principle of the registry.
