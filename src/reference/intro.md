# Introduction of MVM 

Mixin Network is an open-source, lightning-fast, and decentralized W3 platform to bring speed and scalability to the blockchain.
The vision of Mixin is to provide users with a decentralized blockchain infrastructure that always puts security, privacy, and decentralization first.

Since Mixin uses the same degree of privacy but a more flexible TIP scheme to store private keys, developers of other blockchains (such as Ethereum) cannot easily use their existing technical solutions in Mixin ecosystem. 
The purpose of MVM is to facilitate smart contract developers to develop based on Mixin.

MVM allows developers on other networks to migrate their applications directly to Mixin almost without any modification.
