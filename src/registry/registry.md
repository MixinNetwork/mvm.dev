# Introduction

We will talk about the principle of Registry Contract in this chapter. 
Besides, we will show you how to deploy a contract in MVM and call it through Registry Contract.
Finally, some problems you may face in practice will be demonstrated.

## Implementation
The [Registry](#source-code) is the proxy contract in MVM. 
The original smart contract can be executed directly through Registry after being deployed on [MVM](/quorum/join) without any modification.

### function mixin 

`function mixin(bytes memory raw) public returns (bool)` is the entry and the only entry for MVM to call smart contract functions.
All subsequent contract operations need to go through this function.

When MVM calls the mixin function, `raw` will be parsed into relevant parameters as follows:

1. Get process (PID): uuid verifies whether the deployed process is the same as the called process
2. Get nonce: require nonce + 1 per call
3. Get asset id: the id of asset in the mixin
4. Get amount: the amount of assets that need to be manipulated
5. Get extra: contains some information about assets and contracts
6. Get timestamp: no verification currently, which is decided by the own situation of the contract whether to use it or not
7. Get user: a Mixin user ID or a multi-signature account. A corresponding MVM account will be created, if the user does not exist
8. Parse the extra value in step 5: if the asset corresponding to MVM does not exist, the asset will be created
9. Verify Signature
10. Expose parameters by MixinEvent event, you can check these parameters in browser(address in [MVM](/quorum/join))
11. Transfer assets to MVM User contract, [code](https://github.com/MixinNetwork/mvm-contracts/blob/main/contracts/mixin/registry.sol#L204)
12. Run contracts in turn, [code](https://github.com/MixinNetwork/mvm-contracts/blob/main/contracts/mixin/User.sol#L42)
13. Result is returned by `ProcessCalled` event, [code](https://github.com/MixinNetwork/mvm-contracts/blob/main/contracts/mixin/User.sol#L82)

Implementation:

```solidity
function mixin(bytes memory raw) public returns (bool) {
    require(!HALTED, "invalid state");
    require(raw.length >= 141, "event data too small");

    Event memory evt;
    uint256 offset = 0;

    uint128 id = raw.toUint128(offset);
    require(id == PID, "invalid process");
    offset = offset + 16;

    evt.nonce = raw.toUint64(offset);
    require(evt.nonce == INBOUND, "invalid nonce");
    INBOUND = INBOUND + 1;
    offset = offset + 8;

    (offset, id, evt.amount) = parseEventAsset(raw, offset);
    (offset, evt.extra, evt.timestamp) = parseEventExtra(raw, offset);
    (offset, evt.user) = parseEventUser(raw, offset);
    (evt.asset, evt.extra) = parseEventInput(id, evt.extra);

    offset = offset + 2;
    evt.sig = [raw.toUint256(offset), raw.toUint256(offset+32)];
    uint256[2] memory message = raw.slice(0, offset-2).concat(new bytes(2)).hashToPoint();
    require(evt.sig.verifySingle(GROUP, message), "invalid signature");

    offset = offset + 64;
    require(raw.length == offset, "malformed event encoding");

    uint256 balance = balances[assets[evt.asset]];
    if (balance == 0) {
        deposits.push(assets[evt.asset]);
        balance = BALANCE;
    }
    balances[assets[evt.asset]] = balance + evt.amount;

    emit MixinEvent(evt);
    MixinAsset(evt.asset).mint(evt.user, evt.amount);
    return MixinUser(evt.user).run(evt.asset, evt.amount, evt.extra);
}
```

### event ProcessCalled

[ProcessCalled event](https://github.com/MixinNetwork/mvm-contracts/blob/main/contracts/mixin/User.sol#L11) 
reveals the result of the contract function called by Registry, each executed function has a related `ProcessCalled` event.
`process` is the address of the contract, `input` is the function signature and encoded input parameters,
`result` tells whether the function is executed successfully, `output` is the result.

Codeï¼š
```solidity
event ProcessCalled(
    address indexed process,
    bytes input,
    bool result,
    bytes output
);
```

## Summary

We introduced the principle of Registry Contract in this article. We will show you how to deploy a contract in [MVM](/quorum/join),
and how to call a deployed contract through Registry Contract in the following chapters.
